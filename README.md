## I ALSO UPLOAD TO PRINTABLES https://www.printables.com/model/875222-skewer-barrel-collet

## Description

This still uses the 016 o-ring from the original Skewer collet, it just makes the barrels stay in way better, and makes barrels quick swappable.

## Printing

All STLs were exported in print orientation.

Print at 20% infill, 5 walls.
